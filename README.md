# Pong-Game
## Description:

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong using Python's Turtle module. In Pong, two players control paddles on either side of the screen, trying to hit a ball back and forth without missing it.

## Features:

Two-player mode: Players can control the paddles using keyboard keys.
Score tracking: Scores for each player are displayed on the screen.
Ball movement: The ball moves across the screen, bouncing off walls and paddles.

## How to Play:

*Player 1 (Right Paddle):
  *Move Up: Up arrow key
  *Move Down: Down arrow key
*Player 2 (Left Paddle):
  *Move Up: "w" key
  *Move Down: "s" key

## Dependencies:

This game requires Python 3 and the Turtle module, which is usually included in Python's standard library.
